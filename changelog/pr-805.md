Made further improvements to the codebase. Upgraded [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) to the latest version, migrated the state management code from a bespoke helper library to [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), and converted many files into TypeScript along the way.
