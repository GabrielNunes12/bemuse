Bemuse comes with a rudimentary previewer app to preview BMS/bmson notecharts.

## Current feature list:

- Preview SP and DP charts.
- Can play, pause and seek.
- Shows combo counter.
- Reload chart files from disk.

You can access the previewer by going to this URL:

</div>

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>

As the developer has limited resources, no support is provided for this app, although you can [report issues](https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/issues) on the issue tracker.
