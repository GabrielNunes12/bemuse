## Adjusting note speed

As you play higher-level songs, notes becomes more dense and it becomes harder
to read the notes and time them correctly.

To make it easier to read the notes, you can increase the **note speed.** The
note speed multiplier makes note fall down faster, but it also means notes are
more spaced apart:

<div class="BrowserScreenshot">

</div>

To adjust the note speed in-game, use these keys:

| Key                                                 | Action                       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> (Arrow Up)                        | Increase note speed by 0.5x. |
| <kbd>&darr;</kbd> (Arrow Down)                      | Decrease note speed by 0.5x. |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>&uarr;</kbd> (Alt + Arrow Up)   | Increase note speed by 0.1x. |

### View the accuracy data

You can click on the accuracy number to see detailed **accuracy data.**

<div class="BrowserScreenshot">

![Accuracy data in the result screen](assets/user-guide/accuracy-data.jpg)

</div>

This accuracy data is calculated from the **delta time** of each note, measured
in milliseconds.

- If you hit the note too early, the delta time for that note is negative.
- If you hit the note too late, the delta time for that note is positive.

The numbers at the top shows how many notes you hit too early or too late to get
the best (Meticulous) judgment. The histogram shows the distribution of the
delta times. Finally, the numbers at the bottom shows the statistical
[accuracy and precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision)
of your gameplay.

## Adjusting options

You can access the options panel from the Music Selection Screen by clicking the
**Options** button.

<div class="BrowserScreenshot">

![Options panel](assets/user-guide/options.jpg)

</div>

The **Player Settings** lets you customize the in-game experience.

- **Speed** lets you control the note speed modifier. You can also
  [adjust the speed in-game](#adjusting-note-speed).

- **Scratch** lets you decide whether and where to put the turntable lane in the
  game. If turntable lane is active, it’s called **BMS Mode**. Otherwise, it’s
  the normal **Keyboard Mode**. Since different modes results in different
  number of notes, they are considered different levels and have a different
  leaderboard.

- **Panel** lets you pick where to place the panel. The **3D** placement is only
  available in Keyboard Mode (turntable lane will have to be deactivated).

- Some people find the play area too high, making it hard to read the notes.
  **Cover** lets you cover part of the play area, in case it is too high. It
  [helps you concentrate more](https://www.facebook.com/bemusegame/photos/a.872468499492894.1073741828.815335081872903/956741924398884/?type=3&permPage=1)
  on the notes at the bottom of the screen. _Not compatible with 3D mode._

- **BGA** lets you turn the background animations on and off.

- Each song have different tempo, and therefore notes scroll at a different
  speed. **AutoVel** (auto-velocity), when turned on, automatically adjusts the
  note speed modifier so that the note scrolling speed is the same as the last
  song, regardless of song tempo. The Speed option also changes into
  **LeadTime** which lets you specify how long it should take for the note to
  scroll across the screen.

- **Gauge**, when turned on, displays a score gauge at the top of the screen. If
  the gauge runs out the first time, then you missed your chance to get the ‘S’
  grade. If the gauge runs out the second time, then you missed your chance to
  get the ‘A’ grade.

- **Preview** music can be turned on and off.

The **Input Settings** lets you choose which keys you will use to hit the note
in each column.

The **Advanced Settings** lets you set up the game to compensate for audio
latency.
